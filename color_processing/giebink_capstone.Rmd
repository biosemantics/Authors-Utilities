## INTRODUCTION

## METHODS

## RESULTS
The linear SVM had the best performance against the authors' labels in the test set (multiclass mean f1 = 0.4757042), followed by the radial SVM (multiclass mean f1 = 0.4573148), and the manual thresholds approach (mean multiclass f1 = 0.3998657 factoring out performance on 'white' class for equal comparison; else mean multiclass f1 = 0.388777). These results are summarized in tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

```{r}
score_lin <- readRDS('performance/score_lin.rds')
score_thresholds <- readRDS('performance/score_thresholds.rds')
kable(score_lin)
kable(score_thresholds)
