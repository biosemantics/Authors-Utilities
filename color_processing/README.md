# Color processing utilities

[palette_functions.R](https://github.com/biosemantics/Authors-Utilities/blob/master/color_processing/palette_functions.R) 
reads in data with RGB measurements and color description strings, outputs groups of colors with similar descriptions.

[make_palette.R](https://github.com/biosemantics/Authors-Utilities/blob/master/color_processing/make_palette.R)
contains examples using palette functions as well as algorithms (e.g. clustering) to further separate colors based on RGB features.
